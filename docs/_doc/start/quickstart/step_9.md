Now that you've installed the [Salesforce CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli) and the [SFDX-Falcon Plugin](https://github.com/sfdx-isv/sfdx-falcon) you can install any ADK Demo with three simple commands.

```
$ sfdx falcon:adk:clone https://github.com/VivekMChawla/adk-sample.git

$ cd adk-sample

$ sfdx falcon:adk:install
```
<!--
Here are some additional public ADK Demos that you can clone and install.
